      <h3>What is Autism?</h3>
      <p>
        Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by social
        differences, repetitive behaviors, adherence to rules and routines,
        intensely focused special interests, unique sensory experiences/needs,
        and a restless mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        This can feel like a frustrating and continual processing or decoding of
        the world around them. Balancing these symptoms often leads to meltdowns
        where it feels like one is incapable of processing more sensory input or
        shutdowns where one needs to retreat to a silent place for an extended
        period of time before rejoining in normal activities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many times these symptoms are imperceptible to others who are not
        autistic due to camouflaging or masking. Camouflaging/masking is the
        process through which autistic people consciously or subconsciously
        behave in order to appear more socially appropriate. This can affect
        body language, tone of voice, eye contact, word choice, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        People on the spectrum tend to find comfort and relief from
        overstimulation and overthinking by spending time alone, balancing their
        sensory experiences, stimming, and working on/studying special
        interests.
      </p>
      <h3>Diagnosing Autism in Females vs. Males</h3>
      <p>
        Autism was originally defined in the <em>DSM</em> (The Diagnostic and
        Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) in a way that primarily focused
        on how autism presents in males, specifically in childhood.
      </p>
      <p>
        Girls, even when they are young, tend to understand the social
        importance of blending in and becoming a part of the herd to the extent
        that they can create enough social rules and structure on their own to
        help them survive, even in the face of autistic challenges. This allows
        women to go unnoticed for a long period of time without seeking help.
      </p>
      <p>
        Social interactions might feel harder to manage than it seems for
        others, but many might write it off as anxiety or other issues. Most of
        the literature and research on autism has been more concentrated on male
        autistic tendencies, so even when women decide to seek help, the
        information they find may be misleading or unhelpful.
      </p>
      <h3>Characteristics of Autism</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Overthinking in social situations to the point of avoiding contact or
          social gatherings
        </li>

        <li>Easily distressed by sound, light, textures, tastes, or smells</li>
        <li>
          Occasional or frequent shut downs where one feels unable or less able
          to communicate, think clearly, or manage day-to-day activities,
          usually after social interaction or a sensory experience
        </li>
        <li>
          Occasional or frequent melt downs where one must seclude themselves to
          recover so that they can regain normal functioning
        </li>
        <li>
          Operating by a set standard of social rules such as rehearsing
          questions or dialogue before an event to better anticipate timing and
          expected responses
        </li>
        <li>
          Repetitive actions, either overt or covert, such as clicking teeth,
          tapping fingers or toes, bouncing, hand flapping
        </li>
        <li>
          Feeling like life requires much more effort and intention than it does
          for others
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>How Masking Prevents Females from Getting the Help They Need</h3>
      <p>
        Masking is a term that describes behaviors and speech patterns that one
        utilizes to appear "normal." Many autistic women are skilled
        communicators and may even appear to be the life of the party, but this
        is due to learned behavior patterns that they have practiced over time
        to accommodate their unique social needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Masking might come more naturally to women than it does to men due to
        the increased importance placed on social structure and maintaining
        close friendships. This message is driven home by social media at
        society at large and can lead women to think that forcing their social
        success is key to survival, even at the detriment of their mental health
        and sensory needs.
      </p>
      <h3>Embrace Your Super Power</h3>
      <p>
        More and more women are deciding to label their autistic tendencies not
        as a "disorder" but a "difference." Many autistic tendencies can greatly
        benefit individuals and the world at large, tendencies such as unique
        communication styles and creative problem solving, quick learning
        abilities, being extremely empathetic human beings (despite what many
        say), and the list goes on.

        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/momonthespectrum" rel="_blank"
          >new resources are being created</a
        >
        that specifically address autistic women and the unique challenges they
        face, and new online communities are being formed. Being autistic
        doesn't have to hold you down. In many ways, it's a superpower!
